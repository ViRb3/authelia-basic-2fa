# Docker setup
This is a complete Docker setup to demonstrate how to use this project with Authelia and nginx. Please check [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) and follow it to understand how everything works.

The nginx Authelia configuration was taken from [the official docs](https://github.com/authelia/authelia/blob/master/docs/deployment/supported-proxies/nginx.md).
